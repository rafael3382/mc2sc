# Minecraft to Survivalcraft World Converter
This project converts Minecraft worlds into Survivalcraft worlds.

Only supports Java version, 1.19 or newer.
Minecraft converters can be used (eg. Chunker).

## To-do List:
• Make the block translation dictionary a json file which can be modified easily.
• More block translations.
• Rotations for more blocks, like signs, pressure plates.
• Block to furniture conversion.
• Entity conversion support.
• Some kind of interpolation between Minecraft and Survivalcraft terrain in chunk borders.
• User Interface for the tool.
